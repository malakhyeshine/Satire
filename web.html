    This Morning the U.S. Government reported that many families have lost many loved ones. This was a completely unexpected ambush the, military plans, from what we saw, was fool proof. Thousands of U.S soldiers were sent to ISIS headquarters in Iraq but did not return from the mission as it seems that ISIS was a step ahead of us and blew the entire headquarters killing all of our troops that were sent on that mission. There were no survivors from that attack and this puts our country in a vulnerable state.

  The most important question at this point is How? ISIS seemed to somehow get full invasion plans of the U.S. Military just days before U.S. followed through with those plans. We interviewed General Give-me Afourplz, who lives on 324 S. Moonstone Ct., Jacksonville NC, gave this statement “I can’t believe this happened, when I came up with the plan I made sure that there was no possible way of any leaks to any ISIS spies.”

  President Trump gave his condolences on twitter “This is very sad, If only we had a wall protecting us from the explosion. Kanye and I will be making a diss track on ISIS after what they did and I think that is very cooool.” The President is giving his full support to the families that are currently suffering from someone's stupid mistake by preparing a musical performance on stage with artist, Kanye West.


  After looking for answers for so long, journalist team reportedly found a homeless ISIS member on the streets of New York city. He had this to say about the ambush “You know what … I need some money.” The massive explosion cleary must have disorientated him to the point where he can barely function and all he can think of is getting more money to supply ISIS.

  It is truly tragic to see so many loved ones be taken away. There must be extra precaution to keep an event like this to happen again.
